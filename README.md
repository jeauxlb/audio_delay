# Cricket audio delay project

## About
This code delays audio for a configurable amount of time, at a high enough bit-depth and sampling rate for AM radio. Currently the delay is set to be around 5 seconds, which is sufficient for the nominal delay between 774 ABC Melbourne's cricket broadcast, and Channel 9's vision.

## Requirements
1. Arduino (mine is an Arduino Uno R3)
2. [Nootropic Audio Hacker Shield](http://nootropicdesign.com/audiohacker/)
3. An AM radio source
4. 3.5mm audio cables
